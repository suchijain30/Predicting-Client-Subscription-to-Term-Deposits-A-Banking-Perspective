• Objective: The project aimed to provide the banking institution with a reliable tool for predicting whether clients 
would subscribe to a term deposit.
• Process: Firstly, the data are pre-processed and shuffled to divide the test set and training set. Secondly, Machine 
Learning Algorithms is carried out which makes the prediction and then we find the Accuracy of our model.
• Coding: The project employs the Python language and utilizes Python libraries for data exploration, data 
visualization, and data preprocessing. It also utilizes Python's built-in libraries for machine learning algorithms.
